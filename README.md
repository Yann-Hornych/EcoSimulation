# EcoSimulation
Here is the code I used for my simulation on money emergence.
it is written in Python 3.5.
The most important file is cython_code where all the simulation is implemented and especially the part I entirely coded:
update_estimations.
The other files are made to make the code running.
The "main" file is the one with which you fix the exogenous parameters and run the simulation and the "Analysis" file [that I coded myself] is for plotting the data and have the results through a graph.
